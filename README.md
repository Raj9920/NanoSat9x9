# NanoSat9x9
Creating a nanosatellite involves developing three essential electronic subsystems: the avionics board, BMS(battery management system) &amp; RF board 

Using STM32L49 series MCU as it has a wide temp range and provides extensive library and online support for testing & debugging
this project aims to create a Nano satelite as budget friendly as possible
The software used to program the embedded system is Keil uVision as it has stm32 packages to be used and to simulate and test various signals
