# NanoSat9x9
Creating a nanosatellite involves developing three essential electronic subsystems: the avionics board, BMS(battery management system) &amp; RF board 

Using STM32L49 series MCU as it has a wide temp range and provides extensive library and online support for testing & debugging
this project aims to create a Nano satelite as budget friendly as possible
The software used to program the embedded system is Keil uVision as it has stm32 packages to be used and to simulate and test various signals
,Why KEIL uVision 5 compared to stm32 cubemx or micropython?
Keil covers more thna 9000 MCU and 20 MCU maker which provides extensive options and flexibility and it has dedicated enviornemnt for embedded developmen. Lastly, it has extra modules to utilize and rich documentation variety
